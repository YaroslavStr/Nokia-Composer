# Nokia 3310 Music Composer

## Overview

This project was created for the educational purpose after taking a course on Web applications development.
I decided to use the Nokia Composer add-on as the theme of the project to implement the Nokia Composer as a Web application.
This web add-on allows you to repeat the monophonic moonlighting of a melody like from an old Nokia 3310 and create a handwritten melody using the controls for entering the musical notation.

## Usage

To use Nokia 3310 Music Composer user should follow next steps:

### Creating composition process

â€“ Notes for the melody are entered in the `Selected Note` field. A list of basic notes is available for selection: `c d e f g a b`.\
â€“ Standard note duration is `Â¼`, but you can change it by adding a number in front of the note symbol: `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32`. A `.` between the duration and the note increases the duration by half: `4.c = 2c`.\
â€“ You can also add a pause with `â€“` as well as its duration: `2-`.\
â€“ Use the `Make Sharp` button to place a major note `#` in front of the note.\
â€“ Octaves 1-3 are placed after the note and can be chosen by provided buttons.\
â€“ After editing a note, you can add the note to the composition with the `Add Note` button, while the `Clear Composition` button removes the created or chosen song from the phone screen.\
â€“ The `Remove Last` button removes the last note added to the song in case you make a mistake when composing notes :)\
â€“ `Play/Stop` button starts or completely stops playing the song.\
â€“ Created compositions can be saved in the following format from `compositions.json` file in project tree.\
â€“ The `Peek a song` drop-down list allows you to select one of the songs you've already created and added and play it ðŸ™‚
